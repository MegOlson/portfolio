                  <p>For years, I've felt that the best way to get to know someone is by looking at their Pinterest account. However, most aren't interested in such a lengthy approach. So, this will be my shortcut! First, my three favorite things are:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><span style="color:grey">First</span>, the love of my life and future husband. He is the light in my life!</li>
                    <li><span style="color:grey">Second</span> is coffee: in any and all forms.</li>
                    <li><span style="color:grey">Third</span> are peonies: my favorite flower only in season for two, short months - they define beauty!</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>My three favorite things show that I value the big and little things in life! My biggest passion if for musical theatre.I love my family, my friends, and traveling the world when I can afford it. That's about it for my shortcut!

              <p>My professional experience fails to include anything close to Software Development. My background includes coffee and babies, which neither seem to be giving me the upperhand here. However, over the past two years, in between working full-time and obtaining my High School Diploma and AA Degree, I squeezed in as much self-learning as possible. I dabbled in mostly HTML and CSS and <em>touched</em> - and I emphasize touched - in Ruby. I did just enough to know that I enjoyed it and wanted to pursue it. I decided to look for classroom-based bootcamps in the Seattle area and that's how I got here!</p>

            <div class="panel-body" id="about">
              <p>When I was 9 years old, I found a home at the theatre. Musical Theatre is my biggest passion - watching or doing - whatever I can get. I am blessed with a wonderful community theatre that I call my second-family back in Sumner, WA. I started as a singer, picked up acting, and my greatest love finally came with dancing. Musical theatre allows me to do all three. However, with the intesity of this program, it doesn't leave much time for my hobby - or at least not time that is easy to come by. Over the next 6 months, it will be a balancig act, but one that will be well worth it.</p>
