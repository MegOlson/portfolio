              <p>For years, I've felt that the best way to get to know someone is by looking at their Pinterest account. However, most aren't interested in such a lengthy approach. So, this will be my shortcut! First, my three favorite things are: the love of my life and future husband. He is the light in my life! Second is coffee: in any and all forms. Third are peonies: my favorite flower only in season for two, short months - they define beauty! My three favorite things show that I value the big and little things in life! My biggest passion if for musical theatre. I found my home at the theatre when I was 9 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. I love my family, my friends, and traveling the world when I can afford it. That's about it for my shortcut! For more information about literally every aspect of my life that is thoroughly represented on my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/meganaolson/">Pinterest</a> page, feel free to browse!</p>
